<p>Similar to the ILC, Douglas hosts multiple bookable rooms that students may book to work on group projects. These rooms are bigger than the ones in the ILC and students have a separate amount of hours to book these rooms apart from the ILC rooms.</p>

<h5>Extra Quiet Space</h5>
<p>Douglas has a room that has been famously dubbed the "Harry Potter Room" that is an extremely quiet space for students to work. This room looks like it is in the style of the library from Harry Potter, thus giving it its name. This is one of the quietest rooms on campus and is great for those that need absolute focus to work and study.</p>

<!-- QUEENS INNOVATION COMPLEX -->
<a id="qic"></a>
<h3>Queen's Innovation Complex (QIC)</h3>
<h4>Engineering Innovation</h4>
<img src="qic.jpg" alt="Queen's Innovation Complex" style="width:304px;height:228px">
<br>
<font size="1">**The above image is only a design concept**</font>

<p>
The Queen's Innovation Complex (QIC) is a building that aims to become the campus hub for the expertise and collaborative environment that engineers need to become innovators and entrepreneurs. The building is planned to cost $45 million dollars, will be approximately 70,000 square feet and will have a futuristic vibe to it. 
The new high tech teaching environment and design studios will be modelled after the very successful spaces in the Integrated Learning Centre. The building will house specialized classrooms, offices and equipment. The complex will also house two floors of laboratory space, which will support over 20 faculty researchers and the graduate students working under them in their research. Overall the QIC aims to provide space where innovation and creativity will thrive and grow as such spaces are currently very limited and spread around campus. Finally the building will expand opportunities for students by mixing engineers with students from all faculties and disciplines. There will also be a mixing of undergraduate and graduate students to promote innovation and synergy of ideas.
</p>

<p>
"Whether or not they plan to start a business, and regardless of their field of study, today's graduates need to be entrepreneurial," says Principal Daniel Woolf. "They need to think critically and creatively and be able to analyze and assess complex problems. That's what entrepreneurs do. And that's what every student must do to succeed in today's competitive world."
</p>

<p>
The QIC also is also going to ensure that Queen's is a valuable contributor to the Canadian economy. Additionally it will propel Canada's global standing as an innovative nation. The Innovation Complex plans to make Queen's even stronger as an institution that helps to advance Canada's political, social and economic well-being. Lastly, QIC will be able to enhance the roles of graduates in the global marketplace, which is very beneficial.
