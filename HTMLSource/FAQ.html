<a id="academic_services"></a>
<h4>Are there academic advising and counseling services available to students?</h4>

<p>Douglas tutorials offer help sessions led by upper years, with the schedule being emailed to all first years.</p>
<p>EngBounceBack offers upper year facilitators to individually aide developing sustainable learning strategies. </p>
<p>Englinks is a part of the engineering society, and holds exam and midterm prep sessions. </p>
<p>An engineering embedded counselor in the ILC is available to discuss stresses students face and suggests coping mechanisms. </p>
<p>J-Section allows first years to repeat fall semester courses, or to retake them to increase their GPA. They enjoy the benefit of working in smaller class sizes more similar to high school, and end classes halfway through summer. This allows them to get back on track before entering second year.
More information about J-Section can be found through the link below:</p>
