## Compiling the Source
---
The source code for the mobile application is present in the `/HTMLSource` directory, as well as all required assets. The online service [PhoneGap](https://build.phonegap.com/) is used to compile the source folder. It will natively compile an Android and Blackberry build and an iOS build can also be compiled if apple developer credentials are provided.

For ease of use, a fully compiled android version is available as `Queens_Eng_Tour.apk`.
